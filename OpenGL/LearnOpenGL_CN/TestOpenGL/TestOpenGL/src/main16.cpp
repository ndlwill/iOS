 Why does our container now spin around our screen?:
 == ===================================================
 Remember that matrix multiplication is applied in reverse. This time a translation is thus
 applied first to the container positioning it in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 After the translation the rotation is applied to the translated container.

 A rotation transformation is also known as a change-of-basis transformation
 for when we dig a bit deeper into linear algebra. Since we're changing the
 basis of the container, the next resulting translations will translate the container
 based on the new basis vectors. Once the vector is slightly rotated, the vertical
 translations would also be slightly translated for example.

 If we would first apply rotations then they'd resolve around the rotation origin (0,0,0), but
 since the container is first translated, its rotation origin is no longer (0,0,0) making it
 looks as if its circling around the origin of the scene.

 If you had trouble visualizing this or figuring it out, don't worry. If you
 experiment with transformations you'll soon get the grasp of it; all it takes
 is practice and experience.
