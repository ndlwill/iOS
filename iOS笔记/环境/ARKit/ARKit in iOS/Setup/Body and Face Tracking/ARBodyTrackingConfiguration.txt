ARBodyTrackingConfiguration
A configuration that tracks human body poses, planar surfaces, and images using the rear-facing camera.

iOS 13.0
class ARBodyTrackingConfiguration : ARConfiguration

When ARKit identifies a person in the rear camera's feed, it calls session(_:didAdd:), passing an ARBodyAnchor you can use to track the body's movement.

When you enable plane detection and image detection, you can use a body anchor to display a virtual character and set the character on a surface or image that you choose.

By default, frameSemantics includes bodyDetection, which gives you access to the joint positions of a person that ARKit detects in the camera feed via the frame's detectedBody.
