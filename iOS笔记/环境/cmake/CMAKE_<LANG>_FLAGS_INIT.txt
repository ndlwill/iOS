CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT

Value used to initialize the CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS cache entry the first time a build tree is configured for language <LANG>.
###
This variable is meant to be set by a toolchain file.
###
CMake may prepend or append content to the value based on the environment and target platform.
For example, the contents of a xxxFLAGS environment variable will be prepended,
where xxx will be language-specific but not necessarily the same as <LANG> (e.g. CXXFLAGS for CXX, FFLAGS for Fortran, and so on).
