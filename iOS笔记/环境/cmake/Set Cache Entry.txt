set(<variable> <value>... CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE])

Sets the given cache <variable> (cache entry).
Since cache entries are meant to provide user-settable values this does not overwrite existing cache entries by default.
Use the FORCE option to overwrite existing entries.

The <type> must be specified as one of:

BOOL
Boolean ON/OFF value.

FILEPATH
Path to a file on disk.

PATH
Path to a directory on disk.

STRING
A line of text.

INTERNAL
A line of text. cmake-gui(1) does not show internal entries. They may be used to store variables persistently across runs. Use of this type implies FORCE.

The <docstring> must be specified as a line of text providing a quick summary of the option for presentation to cmake-gui(1) users.

If the cache entry does not exist prior to the call or the FORCE option is given then the cache entry will be set to the given value.
Furthermore, any normal variable binding in the current scope will be removed to expose the newly cached value to any immediately following evaluation.

It is possible for the cache entry to exist prior to the call but have no type set if it was created on the cmake(1) command line by a user through the -D<var>=<value> option without specifying a type. In this case the set command will add the type.
Furthermore, if the <type> is PATH or FILEPATH and the <value> provided on the command line is a relative path, then the set command will treat the path as relative to the current working directory and convert it to an absolute path.
