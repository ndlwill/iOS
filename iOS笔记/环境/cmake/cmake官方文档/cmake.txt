CMake is a tool to manage building of source code.

Originally, CMake was designed as a generator for various dialects of Makefile, 
today CMake generates modern buildsystems such as Ninja as well as project files for IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode.


CMake is widely used for the C and C++ languages, but it may be used to build source code of other languages too.

To learn how to build a source code package downloaded from the internet, start with the User Interaction Guide.
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.23/guide/user-interaction/index.html#guide:User%20Interaction%20Guide
This will detail the steps needed to run the cmake(1) or cmake-gui(1) executable and how to choose a generator, and how to complete the build.

The Using Dependencies Guide is aimed at developers wishing to get started using a third-party library.

For developers starting a project using CMake, the CMake Tutorial is a suitable starting point.

The cmake-buildsystem(7) manual is aimed at developers expanding their knowledge of maintaining a buildsystem and becoming familiar with the build targets that can be represented in CMake. 
The cmake-packages(7) manual explains how to create packages which can easily be consumed by third-party CMake-based buildsystems.

==================================================Makefile:
make是一个命令工具，是一个解释makefile中指令的命令工具.
make命令执行时，需要一个 Makefile 文件，以告诉make命令需要怎么样的去编译和链接程序.
