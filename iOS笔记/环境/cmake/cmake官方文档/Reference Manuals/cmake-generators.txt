A CMake Generator is responsible for writing the input files for a native build system.
Exactly one of the CMake Generators must be selected for a build tree to determine what native build system is to be used.
Optionally one of the Extra Generators may be selected as a variant of some of the Command-Line Build Tool Generators to produce project files for an auxiliary IDE.

CMake Generators are platform-specific so each may be available only on certain platforms.
The cmake(1) command-line tool --help output lists available generators on the current platform.
Use its -G option to specify the generator for a new build tree.
The cmake-gui(1) offers interactive selection of a generator when creating a new build tree.

==============================CMake Generators
----------Command-Line Build Tool Generators
These generators support command-line build tools.
In order to use them, one must launch CMake from a command-line prompt whose environment is already configured for the chosen compiler and build tool.

1.Makefile Generators
Borland Makefiles
MSYS Makefiles
MinGW Makefiles
NMake Makefiles
NMake Makefiles JOM
Unix Makefiles
Watcom WMake

2.Ninja Generators
Ninja
Ninja Multi-Config

----------IDE Build Tool Generators
These generators support Integrated Development Environment (IDE) project files. 
Since the IDEs configure their own environment one may launch CMake from any environment.

1.Visual Studio Generators
Visual Studio 6
Visual Studio 7
Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003
Visual Studio 8 2005
Visual Studio 9 2008
Visual Studio 10 2010
Visual Studio 11 2012
Visual Studio 12 2013
Visual Studio 14 2015
Visual Studio 15 2017
Visual Studio 16 2019
Visual Studio 17 2022

2.Other Generators
Green Hills MULTI
Xcode

----------Extra Generators
Some of the CMake Generators listed in the cmake(1) command-line tool --help output may have variants that specify an extra generator for an auxiliary IDE tool.
Such generator names have the form <extra-generator> - <main-generator>. The following extra generators are known to CMake.

CodeBlocks
CodeLite
Eclipse CDT4

Sublime Text 2
