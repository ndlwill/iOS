Generator expressions are evaluated during build system generation to produce information specific to each build configuration. They have the form $<...>.
target_include_directories(tgt PRIVATE /opt/include/$<CXX_COMPILER_ID>)
This would expand to /opt/include/GNU, /opt/include/Clang, etc. depending on the C++ compiler used.

Generator expressions are allowed in the context of many target properties, such as LINK_LIBRARIES, INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, COMPILE_DEFINITIONS and others.
They may also be used when using commands to populate those properties, such as target_link_libraries(), target_include_directories(), target_compile_definitions() and others.
They enable conditional linking, conditional definitions used when compiling, conditional include directories, and more.
The conditions may be based on the build configuration, target properties, platform information, or any other queryable information.

Generator expressions can be nested:
// for test
message("CXX_COMPILER_VERSION=${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION}") // CXX_COMPILER_VERSION前面加个CMAKE进行调试
target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE
  $<$<VERSION_LESS:$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>,4.2.0>:OLD_COMPILER>
)
The above would expand to OLD_COMPILER if the CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION is less than 4.2.0.
