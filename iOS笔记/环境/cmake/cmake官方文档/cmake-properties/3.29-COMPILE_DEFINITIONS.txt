Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.

The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value
Function-style definitions are not supported.
CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).

CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.

New in version 3.26: Any leading -D on an item will be removed.

Contents of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS may use "generator expressions" with the syntax $<...>. See the cmake-generator-expressions(7) manual for available expressions. 
See the cmake-buildsystem(7) manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
