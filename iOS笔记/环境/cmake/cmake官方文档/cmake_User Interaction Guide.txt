Where a software package supplies a CMake-based buildsystem with the source of their software, 
the consumer of the software is required to run a CMake user interaction tool in order to build it.


Well-behaved CMake-based buildsystems do not create any output in the source directory, 
so typically, the user performs an out-of-source build and performs the build there.
First, CMake must be instructed to generate a suitable buildsystem, then the user invokes a build tool to process that generated buildsystem. 
Each consumer of a provided source software package is required to use CMake to generate a buildsystem specific to their system.


Generated buildsystems should generally be treated as read-only. 
The CMake files as a primary artifact should completely specify the buildsystem and there should be no reason to populate properties manually in an IDE for example after generating the buildsystem. 
CMake will periodically rewrite the generated buildsystem, so modifications by users will be overwritten.


The CMake tooling may report errors to the user when processing provided CMake files, 
such as reporting that the compiler is not supported, or the compiler does not support a required compile option, or a dependency can not be found. 
These errors must be resolved by the user by choosing a different compiler, installing dependencies, or instructing CMake where to find them, etc.

Command Line cmake tool:
$ cd some_software-1.4.2
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/the/prefix
$ cmake --build .
$ cmake --build . --target install

It is recommended to build in a separate directory to the source because that keeps the source directory pristine, 
allows for building a single source with multiple toolchains, and allows easy clearing of build artifacts by simply deleting the build directory.

The CMake tooling may report warnings which are intended for the provider of the software, not intended for the consumer of the software. 
Such warnings end with "This warning is for project developers". 
Users may disable such warnings by passing the -Wno-dev flag to cmake(1).
