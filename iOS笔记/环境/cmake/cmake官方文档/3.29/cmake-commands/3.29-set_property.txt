Set a named property in a given scope.

set_property(<GLOBAL                      |
              DIRECTORY [<dir>]           |
              TARGET    [<target1> ...]   |
              SOURCE    [<src1> ...]
                        [DIRECTORY <dirs> ...]
                        [TARGET_DIRECTORY <targets> ...] |
              INSTALL   [<file1> ...]     |
              TEST      [<test1> ...]
                        [DIRECTORY <dir>] |
              CACHE     [<entry1> ...]    >
             [APPEND] [APPEND_STRING]
             PROPERTY <name> [<value1> ...])

Sets one property on zero or more objects of a scope.

The first argument determines the scope in which the property is set. It must be one of the following:
GLOBAL

DIRECTORY:
Scope defaults to the current directory but other directories (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or relative path. 
Relative paths are treated as relative to the current source directory. See also the set_directory_properties() command.
New in version 3.19: <dir> may reference a binary directory.

TARGET

The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of the property to set. 
Remaining arguments are used to compose the property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.


If the APPEND option is given the list is appended to any existing property value (except that empty values are ignored and not appended).
If the APPEND_STRING option is given the string is appended to any existing property value as string, i.e. it results in a longer string and not a list of strings.
When using APPEND or APPEND_STRING with a property defined to support INHERITED behavior (see define_property()), no inheriting occurs when finding the initial value to append to.
If the property is not already directly set in the nominated scope, the command will behave as though APPEND or APPEND_STRING had not been given.
