Path to toolchain file supplied to cmake(1).

###
This variable is specified on the command line when cross-compiling with CMake.
It is the path to a file which is read early in the CMake run and which specifies locations for compilers and toolchain utilities, 
and other target platform and compiler related information.
###

Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted first as relative to the build directory, and if not found, relative to the source directory.

This is initialized by the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE environment variable if it is set when a new build tree is first created.

See the CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES variable for setting other things not directly related to the toolchain.
