https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.29/variable/CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.html#variable:CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME

The name of the operating system for which CMake is to build. See the CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION variable for the OS version.

###
Note that CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is not set to anything by default when running in script mode, since it's not building anything.
###


System Name for Host Builds:
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is by default set to the same value as the CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME variable so that the build targets the host system.


System Name for Cross Compiling:
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME may be set explicitly when first configuring a new build tree in order to enable cross compiling.
In this case the CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION variable must also be set explicitly.
