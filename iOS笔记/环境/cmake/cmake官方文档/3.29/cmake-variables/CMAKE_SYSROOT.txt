Path to pass to the compiler in the --sysroot flag.

###
The CMAKE_SYSROOT content is passed to the compiler in the --sysroot flag, if supported.
###
The path is also stripped from the RPATH/RUNPATH if necessary on installation.
The CMAKE_SYSROOT is also used to prefix paths searched by the find_* commands.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable.

See also the CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE and CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK variables.
