Environment Variables are like ordinary Variables, with the following differences:

Scope:
Environment variables have global scope in a CMake process. They are never cached.

References:
Variable References have the form $ENV{<variable>}, using the ENV operator.

Initialization:
Initial values of the CMake environment variables are those of the calling process. 
Values can be changed using the set() and unset() commands. 
These commands only affect the running CMake process, not the system environment at large. 
Changed values are not written back to the calling process, and they are not seen by subsequent build or test processes.

See the cmake -E env command-line tool to run a command in a modified environment.

Inspection:
See the cmake -E environment command-line tool to display all current environment variables.


The cmake-env-variables(7) manual documents environment variables that have special meaning to CMake.
