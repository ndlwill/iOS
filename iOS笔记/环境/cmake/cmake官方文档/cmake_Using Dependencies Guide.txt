For developers wishing to use CMake to consume a third party binary package, 
there are multiple possibilities regarding how to optimally do so, 
depending on how CMake-aware the third-party library is.


CMake files provided with a software package contain instructions for finding each build dependency. 
Some build dependencies are optional in that the build may succeed with a different feature set if the dependency is missing, and some dependencies are required. 
CMake searches well-known locations for each dependency, 
and the provided software may supply additional hints or locations to CMake to find each dependency.
