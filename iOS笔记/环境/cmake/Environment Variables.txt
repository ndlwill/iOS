Environment Variables are like ordinary Variables, with the following differences:

Scope
Environment variables have global scope in a CMake process. They are never cached.

References
Variable References have the form $ENV{<variable>}.

Initialization
Initial values of the CMake environment variables are those of the calling process.
Values can be changed using the set() and unset() commands.
These commands only affect the running CMake process, not the system environment at large.
Changed values are not written back to the calling process, and they are not seen by subsequent build or test processes.


Set Environment Variable:
set(ENV{<variable>} [<value>])

Sets an Environment Variable to the given value.
Subsequent calls of $ENV{<variable>} will return this new value.

This command affects only the current CMake process, not the process from which CMake was called,
nor the system environment at large, nor the environment of subsequent build or test processes.

If no argument is given after ENV{<variable>} or if <value> is an empty string, then this command will clear any existing value of the environment variable.

Arguments after <value> are ignored. If extra arguments are found, then an author warning is issued.
