==================================================OSX_ARCHITECTURES:
Target specific architectures for macOS.

The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary architecture for targets on macOS (-arch).
This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is created.
Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG> to set the binary architectures on a per-configuration basis, where <CONFIG> is an upper-case name (e.g. OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG).
