Learn about the conditions under which an iOS app will be relaunched by Bluetooth State Restoration.


Bluetooth State Restoration on iOS will relaunch an app in the background for pending Core Bluetooth requests.
There are, though, certain conditions where the system will not relaunch and restore your app regardless of pending requests.

Because of user actions, it’s possible that an app may no longer be eligible to be restored in response to a Bluetooth event.
Therefore it’s important to educate the users of your app, so that they understand how their actions affect the functionality of it.

Well designed apps will be resilient under such conditions.

Notes:
1. App will be activated without needing a relaunch.
2. Users may toggle Bluetooth power through Settings, Control Center, or via Airplane mode.
3. Only if Bluetooth power is not toggled with Airplane Mode. Users may configure the Airplane Mode switch to not toggle Bluetooth power.
4. If the device requires a passcode to unlock, apps will not be relaunched until the device is unlocked for the first time after a restart.
5. Starting in iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, only apps that use AccessorySetupKit to setup Bluetooth accessories will be relaunched.

Also, it’s important to keep in mind that your app will be relaunched and restored if and only if it’s waiting for a specific Bluetooth event or action 
(like scanning, connecting, or a subscribed notification characteristic, and for peripheral apps, actively advertising), 
and the corresponding Bluetooth event has occurred.
