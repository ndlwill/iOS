==========Installation:
sudo gem install cocoapods

==========Sudo-less installation:
If you do not want to grant RubyGems admin privileges for this process, you can tell RubyGems to install into your user directory by passing either the --user-install flag to gem install or by configuring the RubyGems environment. The latter is in our opinion the best solution. 
To do this open up terminal and create or edit your .bash_profile with your preferred editor. Then enter these lines into the file:

export GEM_HOME=$HOME/.gem
export PATH=$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH

Note that if you choose to use the --user-install option, you will still have to configure your .bash_profile file to set the PATH or use the command prepended by the full path. 
You can find out where a gem is installed with gem which cocoapods

$ gem install cocoapods --user-install
$ gem which cocoapods
/Users/eloy/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/gems/cocoapods-0.29.0/lib/cocoapods.rb
$ /Users/eloy/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin/pod install

==========Updating CocoaPods:
To update CocoaPods you simply install the gem again
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods

Or for a pre-release version
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods --pre

If you originally installed the cocoapods gem using sudo, you should use that command again.

Later on, when you're actively using CocoaPods by installing pods, you will be notified when new versions become available with a CocoaPods X.X.X is now available, please update message.

Using a CocoaPods Fork
There are two ways to do this, ###using a Gemfile (recommended)### or using a development build that are in discussion or in implementation stage.
