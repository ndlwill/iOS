Configuring your project to use mergeable libraries:
// 使用可合并动态库，可在发布版本中获得与静态链接类似的应用程序启动速度，同时在调试版本中保持动态链接的构建速度。
Use mergeable dynamic libraries to get app launch times similar to static linking in release builds, 
without losing dynamically linked build times in debug builds.


#####
/*
在 Xcode 14 或更早版本中，您可以使用静态链接或动态链接将来自独立库的代码包含到目标应用中。
构建目标时，您需要将静态库链接到您的应用，这可能会增加构建时间和应用体积。
动态加载器会在运行目标时解析可执行文件中的动态符号，使其指向动态库中的相应地址，这可能会增加应用的启动时间。
*/
In Xcode 14 or earlier, you include code from a separate library in your target using static linking or dynamic linking. 
You link a static library to your app when you build your target, which can increase both your build time and app size. 
The dynamic loader resolves dynamic symbols in the executable to point to the appropriate addresses in the dynamic libraries when you run your target, 
which can increase your app launch time.
#####


#####
In Xcode 15 or later, you can include symbols from a separate, mergeable dynamic library for macOS and iOS app and framework targets. 
Mergeable dynamic libraries include extra metadata so that Xcode can merge the library into another binary, 
similar to linking a static library with -all_load. 
When you enable automatic merging, Xcode enables build settings that make app launching fast and keep debugging and development build times fast.
#####

In this context, a debug or development build is unoptimized, where either the clang debug format is -O0 or the swiftc debug format is -Onone. 
A release build uses optimizations. Xcode represents debug builds with a new build setting, IS_UNOPTIMIZED_BUILD.

#####
In debug builds, Xcode 15 or later treats mergeable dependencies like normal dynamic libraries, 
without the overhead of creating mergeable metadata and merging all the libraries. 
In release builds, Xcode creates the mergeable metadata in your dynamic libraries, and merges dependencies into the target binary.

In release builds, the binary is slightly larger, but avoids the overhead of loading dynamic links at runtime.

==================================================Merge libraries automatically in Xcode
To automatically merge libraries, first open your project in Xcode 15 or later. 
Then, add the MERGED_BINARY_TYPE build setting to your app target, and set the value to automatic.
With this build setting, Xcode treats mergeable dependencies like normal dynamic libraries in debug builds, 
but performs steps in release mode to automatically handle merging for direct dependencies.

For more information on the MERGED_BINARY_TYPE build setting
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/build-settings-reference#Create-Merged-Binary


A direct dependency is a library that meets two criteria:
The library is listed in your target’s Link Binary with Libraries build phase.
The library is the product of another target in your project.

An indirect dependency is any other library dependency that doesn’t meet those two criteria — 
for example, a pre-built library, or a library’s dependencies.


In release builds:
1. Xcode builds direct dependencies of the merged binary target as mergeable. This includes framework and dynamic library (dylib) targets.
2. Xcode combines the mergeable libraries into the merged binary.
3. Xcode also combines any mergeable pre-built XCFrameworks listed in your target’s Link Binary with Libraries build phase.
4. Xcode embeds mergeable target products in either the merged binary product or into a product, such as an app, that contains the merged binary product. Xcode does not include the binaries from the libraries in the embedded copy.

Note
Xcode does not automatically build indirect dependencies as mergeable in release builds. 
To configure indirect dependencies for merging, see the Manually configure merging section below.
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-your-project-to-use-mergeable-libraries#Manually-configure-merging

In debug builds:
1. Xcode builds direct dependencies of the merged binary target normally, and doesn’t generate the metadata to make them mergeable.
2. The merged binary target links dylibs produced by direct dependencies to be reexported.
3. Xcode strips mergeable metadata from any pre-built mergeable XCFrameworks.
4. Xcode embeds those target dependency products in either the merged binary product, or into a product containing the merged binary product. Xcode doesn’t include their binaries in the embedded copy (this is the same as the release build behavior).
5. Xcode also copies the target dependency products into a special location in the merged binary product. This special location contains only the binaries of the target dependency products. The merged binary product has an additional @rpath that points to the special location.


==================================================Manually configure merging
In some cases, you may want to manually configure merging between your app or framework target and dependent libraries. 
For example, you might not want to automatically merge dependencies that you share between an app and an app extension if you’re concerned about the app extension’s binary size. 
To set up manual merging, configure your app or framework target, then configure your dependent libraries.


In your app or framework target, add the build setting MERGED_BINARY_TYPE and set it to manual. After you add that setting to your target:
1. In release builds, Xcode merges the products of any of its direct dependencies which have MAKE_MERGEABLE enabled using the linker flags -merge_framework, -merge-l, and so on.
2. In debug builds, Xcode links any of your target’s direct dependencies which have MERGEABLE_LIBRARY enabled, but not MAKE_MERGEABLE with the linker flags -reexport_framework, -reexport-l, and so on.
3. Xcode uses normal linking for targets that don’t have MERGEABLE_LIBRARY enabled. This is the same linking that Xcode uses for static libraries, or dynamic libraries that aren’t mergeable.


For each dependent library that you want to use merging, add the build setting MERGEABLE_LIBRARY, and set it to YES
For more information on the MERGEABLE_LIBRARY build setting, see Build Mergeable Library.

==================================================Create a pre-built mergeable library
To create a mergeable library that you can distribute as a binary package rather than as source:
1. Enable the Build Mergeable Library build setting on your library target.
2. Create an XCFramework from an archive of your library. For more information, see Creating a multiplatform binary framework bundle.
