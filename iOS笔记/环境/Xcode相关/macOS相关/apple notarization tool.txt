xcrun --find notarytool

Starting November 1, 2023, the Apple notary service no longer accepts uploads from altool or Xcode 13 or earlier. 
If you notarize your Mac software with the Apple notary service using the altool command-line utility or Xcode 13 or earlier, you need to transition to the notarytool command-line utility or upgrade to Xcode 14 or later.
