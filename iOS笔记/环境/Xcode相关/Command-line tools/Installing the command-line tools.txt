Installing the command-line tools
Install command-line tools for Xcode using an installer package or the Terminal app.


#####
// Xcode 捆绑了 clang、notarytool、xcodebuild 和 xcrun 等命令行工具。
Xcode comes bundled with command-line tools such as clang, notarytool, xcodebuild, and xcrun.
If you install Xcode on your Mac, then you don’t need to install the command-line tools separately.
#####


#####
Apple offers the Command Line Tools for Xcode package as an alternative to a full Xcode installation. 
#####
This package is useful for installing the command-line tools if you work outside of Xcode or use UNIX-style commands to build your apps. 
The package contains the same macOS SDK, man pages, and toolchain binaries that ship with Xcode. 
You can download a specific version of the package or install its latest version for your Mac from the command line. 
The system installs the package at the following path: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools.


Important
Commands such as xcodebuild and xctrace only ship with Xcode, and aren’t in the Command Line Tools for Xcode package.
