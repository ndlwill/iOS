Create machine learning models for use in your app.
iOS 15.0+


You can train models to perform tasks like recognizing images, extracting meaning from text, or finding relationships between numerical values.

You train a model to recognize patterns by showing it representative samples. 
For example, you can train a model to recognize dogs by showing it lots of images of different dogs. 
After you’ve trained the model, you test it out on data it hasn’t seen before, and evaluate how well it performed the task. 
When the model is performing well enough, you’re ready to integrate it into your app using Core ML.
