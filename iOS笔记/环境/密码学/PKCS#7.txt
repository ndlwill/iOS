https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_7

In cryptography, "PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax" (a.k.a. "CMS") is a standard syntax for storing signed and/or encrypted data.
PKCS #7 is one of the family of standards called Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) created by RSA Laboratories.

PKCS #7 files may be stored both as raw DER format or as PEM format.
PEM format is the same as DER format but wrapped inside Base64 encoding and sandwiched in between ‑‑‑‑‑BEGIN PKCS7‑‑‑‑‑ and ‑‑‑‑‑END PKCS7‑‑‑‑‑.
Windows uses the ".p7b" file name extension[6] for both these encodings.

A typical use of a PKCS #7 file would be to store certificates and/or certificate revocation lists (CRL).

Here's an example of how to first download a certificate, then wrap it inside a PKCS #7 archive and then read from that archive:
echo '' | openssl s_client -connect example.org:443 -host example.org 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 > example.org.cer 2>/dev/null
openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile example.org.cer -out example.org.cer.pem.p7b
openssl pkcs7 -in example.org.cer.pem.p7b -noout -print_certs
