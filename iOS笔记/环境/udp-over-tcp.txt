UDP-Over-TCP is a proxy
It works on transport layer, which transfers payload of UDP packet over TCP

For example: app sends hello to github.com over UDP and github.com replies nice. When using UDP-Over-TCP, the communication is as follow:

sequenceDiagram
app ->> client: [udp] github.com hello
client ->> server: [tcp] github.com hello
server ->> github.com: [udp] hello
github.com -->> server: [udp] nice
server -->> client: [tcp] nice
client -->> app: [udp] nice
