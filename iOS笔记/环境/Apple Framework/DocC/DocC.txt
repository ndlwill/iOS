DocC, or Documentation Compiler, makes it easy to produce rich and engaging developer documentation for your Swift frameworks and packages.

==================================================Writing Symbol Documentation in Your Source Files
1. Add a Basic Description for Each Symbol
If a symbol already has a source comment that begins with two forward slashes (//), 
insert an additional forward slash (/) to convert it to a documentation comment. 
DocC uses the first line of a documentation comment as the summary.


Tip
DocC also supports multiline documentation comments. 
Begin a comment with a forward slash and two asterisks (/**), 
and terminate it with an asterisk and a forward slash (*/). 
Content you add in between becomes the documentation.


Insert blank lines to break text into separate paragraphs.


Any paragraphs you add appear below the Discussion header in the symbol reference page that DocC generates.
When writing content for a Discussion section, use documentation markup.

2. Describe the Parameters of a Method
For methods that take parameters, document those parameters directly below the summary, 
or the Discussion section, if you include one. Describe each parameter in isolation. Discuss its purpose and, 
where necessary, the range of acceptable values.

DocC supports two approaches for documenting the parameters of a method. 
You can add a Parameters section, or one or more parameter fields. #####Both use Markdown’s list syntax.#####

A Parameters section begins with a single list item that contains the Parameters keyword and terminates with a colon (:). 
Individual parameters appear as nested list items. 
A colon separates a parameter’s name from its description.

Parameter fields omit the parent list item and include the Parameter keyword in each of the individual list items, 
between the list item marker and the name of the parameter.


3. Describe the Return Value of a Method
There are no restrictions for where you add the Returns section in a documentation comment, 
other than it must come after the summary, 
and the Discussion section, if you include one.

Note
DocC supports a single Returns section. Including more than one section results in undefined behavior.


4. Describe the Thrown Errors of a Method
Similar to a Returns section, there are no restrictions for where you add a Throws section, 
other than it must come after the summary, and the Discussion section, if you include one.

Note
DocC supports a single Throws section. Including more than one section results in undefined behavior.

In addition, DocC includes features that allow you to create even richer documentation for your symbols:

Use symbol links instead of code voice when referring to other symbols in your project. 
Symbol links allow you to quickly navigate your project’s documentation when viewing in a browser.

Use extension files to provide additional content for your symbols, 
such as code examples and images, and to help keep the size of their in-source comments manageable.
