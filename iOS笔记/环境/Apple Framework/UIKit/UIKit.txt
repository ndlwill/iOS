Transition: 过渡
Protocol UIContentContaine:
Responding to environment changes:
willTransition(to:with:)
Notifies the container that its trait collection changed.
/*
UIKit calls this method before changing the current object’s traits and before calling the traitCollectionDidChange(_:) method of any affected views and view controllers.
Implementors of this method can use it to adapt the interface based on the values in the newCollection parameter.
A common use of this method is to make changes to the high-level presentation style when the current size class changes.
For example, a container view controller that manages multiple child view controllers might change the number of child view controllers it displays onscreen when the size class changes.
A standard view controller might use this method to change the constraints on the views it manages. 
Use the provided coordinator object to animate any changes you make.

If you override this method in your own objects, always call super at some point in your implementation so that UIKit can forward the trait changes to the associated presentation controller and to any child view controllers.
View controllers forward the trait change message to their child view controllers. 
Presentation controllers forward the trait change to their presented view controller.
*/

viewWillTransition(to:with:)
Notifies the container that the size of its view is about to change.
/*
UIKit calls this method before changing the size of a presented view controller’s view.
You can override this method in your own objects and use it to perform additional tasks related to the size change.
For example, a container view controller might use this method to override the traits of its embedded child view controllers. 
Use the provided coordinator object to animate any changes you make.

If you override this method in your custom view controllers, always call super at some point in your implementation so that UIKit can forward the size change message appropriately.
View controllers forward the size change message to their views and child view controllers.
Presentation controllers forward the size change to their presented view controller.
