Optimizing ProMotion refresh rates for iPhone 13 Pro and iPad Pro
Provide custom animated content for ProMotion displays.


The iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and the iPad Pro ProMotion displays are capable of dynamically switching between:
Faster refresh rates up to 120Hz
Slower refresh rates down to 24Hz or 10Hz


刷新率表示屏幕在 1 秒内刷新画面的次数
120Hz：屏幕每秒刷新 120 次。
更高的刷新率意味着画面更新更频繁


Some framework animation features handle frame pacing automatically for you, including:
UIKit
SwiftUI
SpriteKit
CAAnimation


Important
Use lower refresh rates whenever possible to save power, because higher refresh rates can result in significant power consumption.
