Create 3D games and add 3D content to apps using high-level scene descriptions, and easily add animations,
physics simulation, particle effects, and realistic physically based rendering.

Unlike lower-level APIs such as Metal and OpenGL that require you to implement in precise detail the rendering algorithms that display a scene,
SceneKit requires only descriptions of your scene’s contents and the actions or animations you want it to perform.

==================================================class SCNScene : NSObject
A container for the node hierarchy and global properties that together form a displayable 3D scene.
To display your scene, you need to load it at runtime, then set it as the scene property of an SCNView
guard let myScene = SCNScene(named: "MyScene") else { fatalError("Unable to load scene file.") }
scnView.scene = myScene // Your app's SCNView

To display 3D content with SceneKit, you create a scene containing a hierarchy of the nodes and attributes that together represent your visual elements.

Creating a Scene:
The simplest way to create a scene is through Xcode’s SceneKit Scene Editor.
Start by importing one or more assets from a 3D editor, such as Blender.
Then you adjust the positions and attributes of the assets, and set global scene properties, such as lighting environment, to compose your scene.
The scene editor creates a .scn file, which you save to a .scnassets folder in the app bundle.
When you build your project, Xcode optimizes the scene file for your target platform.

==================================================class SCNView : UIView
A view for displaying 3D SceneKit content.
