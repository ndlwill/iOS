Creating a Core Graphics Image from a vImage Buffer
Create displayable representations of vImage buffers.

vImage provides a function for creating Core Graphics images from vImage buffers. This function allows you to display the results of a vImage operation to your user.

You create a Core Graphics image from the buffer, and initialize a UIImage instance from that.
The createCGImage(format:flags:) function returns a CGImage instance based on the supplied Core Graphics image format

The following example shows how to create a Core Graphics image from a vImage buffer:

iOS 13.0: createCGImage
let result = try? destinationBuffer.createCGImage(format: format)

if let result = result {
    // Assumes `imageView` is a `UIImageView`
    imageView.image = UIImage(cgImage: result)
}
