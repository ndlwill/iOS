Simulate and render 3D content for use in your augmented reality apps.

RealityKit provides high-performance 3D simulation and rendering capabilities you can use to create visionOS apps or to create augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS, macOS, and tvOS.
RealityKit is an AR-first 3D framework that leverages ARKit to seamlessly integrate virtual objects into the real world.

Use RealityKit’s rich functionality to create compelling augmented reality (AR) experiences.
Create and import full RealityKit scenes with models, animations, and Spatial Audio by using Reality Composer Pro for visionOS.
Build or modify scenes at runtime by adding 3D models, shape primitives, and sounds from code.
Have virtual objects interact with objects in the real-world.
Animate objects, both manually and with physics simulations.
Respond to user input and changes in a person’s surroundings.
Synchronize across devices and use SharePlay to enable group AR experiences.
