Metal Performance Shaders
Optimize graphics and compute performance with kernels that are fine-tuned for the unique characteristics of each Metal GPU family.

The Metal Performance Shaders framework contains a collection of highly optimized compute and graphics shaders that are designed to integrate easily and efficiently into your Metal app. 
Metal Performance Shaders can be used along with your appâ€™s existing Metal resources (such as the MTLCommandBuffer, MTLTexture, and MTLBuffer objects) and shaders.

The Metal Performance Shaders framework supports the following functionality:
Apply high-performance filters to, and extract statistical and histogram data from images.
Implement and run neural networks for machine learning training and inference.
Solve systems of equations, factorize matrices and multiply matrices and vectors.
Accelerate ray tracing with high-performance ray-geometry intersection testing.
