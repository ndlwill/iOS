A publisher that exposes a method for outside callers to publish elements.

protocol Subject<Output, Failure> : AnyObject, Publisher
protocol Publisher<Output, Failure>
A subject is a publisher that you can use to ”inject” values into a stream, by calling its send(_:) method. 



final class CurrentValueSubject<Output, Failure> where Failure : Error
A subject that wraps a single value and publishes a new element whenever the value changes.
Unlike PassthroughSubject, CurrentValueSubject maintains a buffer of the most recently published element.
Calling send(_:) on a CurrentValueSubject also updates the current value, making it equivalent to updating the value directly.



final class PassthroughSubject<Output, Failure> where Failure : Error
A subject that broadcasts elements to downstream subscribers.
Unlike CurrentValueSubject, a PassthroughSubject doesn’t have an initial value or a buffer of the most recently-published element.
A PassthroughSubject drops values if there are no subscribers, or its current demand is zero.
