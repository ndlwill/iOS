ARMeshAnchor
An anchor for a physical object that ARKit detects and recreates virtually using a polygonal mesh.

iOS 13.4
class ARMeshAnchor : ARAnchor

ARKit subdivides the reconstructed, real-world scene surrounding the user into mesh anchors.

Mesh anchors constantly update their data as ARKit refines its understanding of the real world. 
Although ARKit updates a mesh to reflect a change in the physical environment (such as when a person pulls out a chair), 
the mesh's subsequent change is not intended to reflect in real time.


Accessing the Mesh:
var geometry: ARMeshGeometry
3D information about the mesh such as its shape and classifications.


ARMeshGeometry:
Mesh information stored in an efficient, array-based format.
iOS 13.4
class ARMeshGeometry : NSObject

The information in this class holds the geometry data for a single anchor of the scene mesh. 
Each vertex in the anchor's mesh represents one connection point. Every three-vertex combination forms a unique triangle called a face. 
Each face includes an outside-directional normal and a classification. 
If ARKit cannot classify a particular face, the value is 0, –– the raw value for ARMeshClassification.none.
