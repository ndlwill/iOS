ARPlaneAnchor
An anchor for a 2D planar surface that ARKit detects in the physical environment.

iOS 11.0
class ARPlaneAnchor : ARAnchor

When you enable planeDetection in a world tracking session, ARKit notifies your app of all the surfaces it observes using the device's back camera.
ARKit calls your delegate's session(_:didAdd:) with an ARPlaneAnchor for each unique surface. 
Each plane anchor provides details about the surface, like its real-world position and shape.

The width and length of a plane (the planeExtent) span the xz-plane of an ARPlaneAnchor instance's local coordinate system. 
The y-axis of the plane anchor is the planeâ€™s normal vector.
