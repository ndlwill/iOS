ARObjectScanningConfiguration
A configuration that recognizes objects and collects high-fidelity data about specific objects using the rear-facing camera.

iOS 12.0
class ARObjectScanningConfiguration : ARConfiguration

To create an app that recognizes objects in the physical environment, first you scan them during development using ARObjectScanningConfiguration. 
After youâ€™ve scanned an object, call createReferenceObject(transform:center:extent:completionHandler:) to turn it into an ARReferenceObject that you can use to detect it again at run-time. 
When users run your app, you ask ARKit to look for your scanned obects by running a world tracking configuration and assigning reference objects to its detectionObjects property.

Important:
ARObjectScanningConfiguration is for use only in development scenarios. 
Because the high-fidelity spatial mapping required by object scanning has a high performance and energy cost, many ARKit features are disabled that aren't required for object scanning.
