ARGeoTrackingConfiguration
A configuration that tracks locations with GPS, map data, and a device's compass.

iOS 14.0
class ARGeoTrackingConfiguration : ARConfiguration
This configuration creates location anchors (ARGeoAnchor) that specify a particular latitude, longitude, and optionally, altitude to enable an app to track geographic areas of interest in an AR experience.

Important:
The isSupported property returns true for this class on iOS 14 & iPadOS 14 devices that have an A12 chip or later and cellular (GPS) capability. 
Geotracking is available in specific geographic locations. To determine availability at the userâ€™s location at runtime, call checkAvailability(completionHandler:).

Geotracking occurs exclusively outdoors. 
If a geotracking app navigates users between waypoints, your app needs to handle any events along a route. 
The user must have an internet connection, and you can provide them information about data usage, as described in ARGeoAnchor.
