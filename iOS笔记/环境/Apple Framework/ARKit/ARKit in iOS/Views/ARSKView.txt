SKView
A view subclass that renders a SpriteKit scene.
iOS 7.0
class SKView : UIView
You present a scene by calling the view’s presentScene(_:) method. 
When a scene is presented by the view, it alternates between running its simulation (which animates the content) and rendering the content for display. 
You can pause the scene by setting the view’s isPaused property to true.



ARSKView
A view that blends virtual 2D content from SpriteKit into the 3D space of an augmented reality experience.

iOS 11.0
class ARSKView : SKView

Use the ARSKView class to create augmented reality experiences that position 2D elements in 3D space within a device camera view of the real world. 
When you run the view's provided ARSession object:
1. The view automatically renders the live video feed from the device camera as the scene background.
2. When you implement ARSKViewDelegate methods to associate SpriteKit content with real-world positions, the view automatically scales and rotates those SpriteKit nodes so that they appear to track the real world seen by the camera.
