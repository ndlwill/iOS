class ARView

Use an ARView instance to display rendered 3D graphics to the user. 
You typically add a single view to your app’s storyboard, and then provide an outlet for that view in your code. 
Alternatively, you can create and add a view to your view hierarchy programmatically at runtime, as you would any other view.

A view has a single Scene instance that you access through the read-only scene property. 
To the view’s Scene instance you add one or more AnchorEntity instances that tell the view’s AR session how to tether content to something in the real world. 
To each anchor, you attach a hierarchy of other Entity instances that make up the content of the scene.

Additionally, you can use the view to:
Configure render options, environmental characteristics, and the camera mode.
Handle platform-appropriate user interaction in the form of mouse, keyboard, or gesture input.
Find entities at a given point in the view.
Access statistics and visualizations that help you debug your app.
