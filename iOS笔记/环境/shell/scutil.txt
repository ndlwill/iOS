Invoke scutil. You will be placed at the scutil prompt.

Enter open to open the session with configd.

Enter list. You will see a set of keys, some of which are provided by the System Configuration framework (such as the keys in the File: domain), some of which are obtained from /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist (the Setup: keys), and some of which are published by the configuration agents (the State: keys).

Enter show State:/Network/Global/DNS to display the DNS dictionary. You should see a list of DNS servers and search domains configured on your system.

Enter close, then quit.

macOS 的 /etc/resolv.conf 文件是由 scutil 管理的 // 不推荐对他进行操作
Sometimes /etc/resolv.conf would be magically restored to its original configuration

OS X has a daemon called configd, which magically collects configuration information, sends notifications, 
and maintains a dynamic database of the current settings.
The command-line tools to interface with the configuration daemon are scselect and scutil.
scutil enables much more fine-grained control over the current network configuration.
Unfortunately, it only really offers a command-line interface to modify the configuration database. 

To retrieve the current primary network interface:
scutil
> open
> get State:/Network/Global/IPv4
> d.show
<dictionary> {
  PrimaryService : 7BB2FEBC-B166-11D9-AA42-000A95EED02C
  Router : 198.32.18.254
  PrimaryInterface : en0
}
> quit

To retrieve the current DNS settings, 
having retrieved the ID (that long hex string) of the primary service as shown above:
scutil
> open
> get State:/Network/Service/PRIMARY_SERVICE_ID/DNS
> d.show
<dictionary> {
  ServerAddresses : <array> {
    0 : 198.35.23.2
    1 : 198.32.56.32
  }
  DomainName : apple.co.uk
}
> quit

To set the resolver configuration, with a domain of 'apple.co.uk' 
and DNS name server IPs of 198.35.23.2 and 198.32.56.32, 
and the primary network service ID as obtained above. 
Root privileges are required for the modification:
sudo scutil
> open
> d.init
> d.add ServerAddresses * 198.35.23.2 198.32.56.32
> d.add DomainName apple.co.uk
> set State:/Network/Service/PRIMARY_SERVICE_ID/DNS
> quit
This last procedure will update /etc/resolv.conf for you as the change filters through the system.

The only problem is this is not persistent across reboots. 


To reset the network services as per your system preferences, or via DHCP, 
I used scselect to change the network location. 
This causes the entire network configuration to be re-initialised.
