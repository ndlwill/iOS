Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: 
it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, 
and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible. (https://ninja-build.org/)

Ninja instead of make
Ninja can be used instead of make, in particular as a different generator in cmake.

And on Mac the easiest/fastest way to achieve this is brew install ninja.
