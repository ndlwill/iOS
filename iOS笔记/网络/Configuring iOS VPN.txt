第二层隧道协议（英语：Layer Two Tunneling Protocol，缩写为L2TP）是一种虚拟隧道协议，通常用于虚拟专用网。L2TP协议自身不提供加密与可靠性验证的功能，可以和安全协议搭配使用，从而实现数据的加密传输。经常与L2TP协议搭配的加密协议是IPsec，当这两个协议搭配使用时，通常合称L2TP/IPsec。

iOS:
To configure an iOS device to connect to the Client VPN, follow these steps:

Navigate to Settings -> General-> VPN -> Add VPN Configuration...
Type: set to L2TP.
Description: This can be anything you want to name this connection, for example, "Work VPN."
Server: Enter the hostname (e.g. .com) or the active WAN IP (e.g. XXX.XXX.XXX). Hostname is encouraged instead of active WAN IP  because it is more reliable in cases of WAN failover. Admin can find them in Dashboard, under Security appliance > Monitor > Appliance status.
Account: Enter the username
Password: Enter if desired. If the password is left blank, it will need to be entered each time the device attempts to connect to the Client VPN.
Secret: Enter shared secret that admin created in Security appliance > Configure > Client VPN settings.
Ensure that Send All Traffic is set to On.
Save the configuration.
