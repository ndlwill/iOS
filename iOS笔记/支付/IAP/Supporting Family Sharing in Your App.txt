Provide service to share subscriptions and non-consumable products to family members

Family Sharing allows a user to share access to auto-renewable subscriptions or non-consumables with up to five family members on all of their Apple devices.

Enabling Family Sharing for a subscription can make your content or service more appealing to subscribers and may encourage conversion to a paid subscription, increase user engagement, and improve retention. 

Developers can choose to turn on Family Sharing for in-app purchases and non-consumables in App Store Connect.
Users can also choose whether to share their purchases with family.

When users share a purchase through Family Sharing, each family member gets their own unique receipts and transactions.
Process the transactions in the same way you already handle purchases — you don’t need any special logic for shared products.
However, you do need to implement a new method in your transaction observer, and listen for a new notification type in server notifications.
Specifically, to support Family Sharing, you need to:

Enable Family Sharing for your in-app purchase in App Store Connect
During runtime check whether in-app purchases support Family Sharing using either isFamilyShareable in Product or isFamilyShareable in SKProduct.
Process purchased and restored transactions in your app.
Implement paymentQueue(_:didRevokeEntitlementsForProductIdentifiers:) in your transaction observer to handle conditions in which products are no longer shared.
Listen for the REVOKE notification_type from App Store server notifications on your server.
