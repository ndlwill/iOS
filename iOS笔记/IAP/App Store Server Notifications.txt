App Store Server Notifications is a server-to-server service for auto-renewable subscriptions and in-app purchase refunds. 


App Store Server Notifications is a server-to-server service that notifies you in real time when the status of in-app purchases and refunds changes. 
Use the data in the notifications to update your user-account database, and to monitor and respond to in-app purchase refunds.

To receive server notifications from the App Store, provide your serverâ€™s HTTPS URL in App Store Connect.

Notifications cover events in the in-app purchase life cycle, including new subscription purchases and renewals, refunds, and more.
