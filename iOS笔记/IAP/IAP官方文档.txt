Original API for In-App Purchase
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/original_api_for_in-app_purchase

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstorereceipts/app_store_receipt_data_types

Transaction Identifiers:
type original_transaction_id
The transaction identifier of the original purchase.

type transaction_id
A unique identifier for a transaction such as a purchase, restore, or renewal.

Receipt and Subscription Status：
type status
The status of the app receipt.

type auto_renew_status
The renewal status for the auto-renewable subscription.

type is_in_billing_retry_period
An indicator of whether an auto-renewable subscription is in the billing retry period.

type is_in_intro_offer_period
An indicator of whether an auto-renewable subscription is in the introductory price period.

type is_trial_period
An indicator of whether an auto-renewable subscription is in the free trial period.

Dates and Intent：
type expiration_intent
The reason a subscription expired.

type cancellation_date_ms
The time and date that Apple customer support canceled a transaction or the time and date the user upgraded an auto-renewable subscription.

type expires_date_ms
The time in milliseconds a subscription expires or renews.

Promotions and Offers：
type promotional_offer_id
The identifier of the promotional offer for an auto-renewable subscription that the user redeemed.

type offer_code_ref_name
The offer-reference name of the subscription offer code that the customer redeemed.

Family Sharing：
type in_app_ownership_type
The relationship of the user with the family-shared purchase to which they have access.

==================================================Choosing a Receipt Validation Technique
There are two ways to verify a receipt's authenticity:
Local, on-device receipt validation, recommended to validate the signature of the receipt for apps with in-app purchases.
Server-side receipt validation with the App Store, recommended for persisting in-app purchases to maintain and manage purchase records.

For auto-renewable subscription management, server-side receipt validation gives key advantages over on-device receipt validation.

On-device versus server-side validation for auto-renewable subscriptions：
On-device validation            Server-side validation

Validates authenticity of receipt   Yes     Yes
Includes renewal transactions       Yes     Yes
Includes additional user subscription information       No      Yes
Handles renewals without client dependency      No      Yes
Resistant to device clock change        No      Yes

In order for on-device receipt validation to include renewal transactions, there must be an internet connection to refresh the receipt.

###
Although receipts typically update immediately after a completed purchase or restored purchase, changes can happen at other times when the app is not running. 
When necessary, call SKReceiptRefreshRequest to ensure the receipt you are working with is up-to-date, such as when a subscription renews in the background. This refresh requires a network connection.
###

------------------------------Validating Receipts with the App Store
Fetch the Receipt Data：
Send this Base64-encoded data to your server.

// Get the receipt if it's available
if let appStoreReceiptURL = Bundle.main.appStoreReceiptURL,
    FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: appStoreReceiptURL.path) {

    do {
        let receiptData = try Data(contentsOf: appStoreReceiptURL, options: .alwaysMapped)
        print(receiptData)

        let receiptString = receiptData.base64EncodedString(options: [])

        // Read receiptData
    }
    catch { print("Couldn't read receipt data with error: " + error.localizedDescription) }
}

Send the Receipt Data to the App Store：
On your server, create a JSON object with the receipt-data, password (if the receipt contains an auto-renewable subscription), 
and exclude-old-transactions keys detailed in requestBody.

Submit this JSON object as the payload of an HTTP POST request. 
Use the test environment URL https://sandbox.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt when testing your app in the sandbox and while your application is in review. 
Use the production URL https://buy.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt when your app is live in the App Store.

Important：
Verify your receipt first with the production URL; 
then verify with the sandbox URL if you receive a 21007 status code. 
This approach ensures you do not have to switch between URLs while your application is tested, reviewed by App Review, or live in the App Store.

Parse the Response：
The App Store's response payload is a JSON object that contains the keys and values detailed in responseBody.
The in_app array contains the non-consumable, non-renewing subscription, and auto-renewable subscription items previously purchased by the user. 
Check the values in the response for these in-app purchase types to verify transactions as needed.

###
For auto-renewable subscription items, parse the response to get information about the currently active subscription period. 
When you validate the receipt for a subscription, latest_receipt contains the latest encoded receipt, which is the same as the value for receipt-data in the request, 
and latest_receipt_info contains all the transactions for the subscription, including the initial purchase and subsequent renewals but not including any restores.
###

You can use these values to check whether an auto-renewable subscription has expired. Use these values along with the expiration_intent subscription field to get the reason for expiration.

###
Receipts for auto-renewable subscriptions can grow over time since the renewal transactions stay in the receipt forever. 
To optimize performance, the App Store may truncate sandbox receipts to remove old transactions. 
When validating receipts for transactions made in the sandbox environment, consider creating new test accounts instead of reusing old accounts to test subscription purchases.

introductory offers for auto-renewable subscriptions

An introductory offer is a limited-time discounted price or free trial for the initial period of a subscription.

When you set up an introductory offer, it automatically appears on your app’s product page on the App Store for eligible users.
You can also display introductory offers within your app.
When displaying offers in your app, use receipt validation to ensure that you’re only showing offers to people who can redeem them. 

There are three types of introductory offers: free trial, pay up front, and pay as you go.

Although you can create an introductory offer for each subscription product in App Store Connect, each person is only eligible to redeem one introductory offer per subscription group.


Once an introductory offer is available to customers, only the End Date of the in effect introductory offer can be edited. 
For introductory offers scheduled for the future, the start and end dates can be edited. 
To edit the duration or price of any introductory offer after it's been created, you must create a new introductory offer.

App Store Connect allows you to set an introductory offer for each subscription product in App Store Connect. 
You can have multiple offers in each subscription group. New and returning customers are only eligible to use one introductory offer per subscription group. 
For example, if a customer uses a free trial and then upgrades to a subscription product in the same group that also has a free trial, 
they aren't eligible for the second offer.


Apps with auto-renewable subscriptions can offer a discounted introductory price, including a free trial, to eligible users. 
You can make introductory offers to customers who haven’t previously received an introductory offer for the given product, or for any products in the same subscription group.
Start by setting up introductory offers in App Store Connect. 
Then, in your app, determine if the user is eligible to receive an introductory offer. 
When the app queries the App Store for a list of available products, display the introductory pricing if the user is eligible to receive them.

Determine Eligibility:
To determine if a user is eligible for an introductory offer, check their receipt:
1.Validate the receipt as described in Validating receipts with the App Store.
2.In the receipt, check the values of the is_trial_period and the is_in_intro_offer_period for all in-app purchase transactions. 
If either of these fields are true for a given subscription, the user is not eligible for an introductory offer on that subscription product or any other products within the same subscription group. 
Use subscription_group_identifier in the responseBody.Pending_renewal_info array to determine the subscription group to which the subscription belongs.

Typically, you check the user's eligibility from your server. Determine eligibility early—for example, on the first launch of the app, if possible.

Based on the receipt, you will find that new and returning customers are eligible for introductory offers, including free trials:
New subscribers are always eligible.
Lapsed subscribers who renew are eligible if they haven't previously used an introductory offer for the given product (or any product within the same subscription group).
Existing subscribers are not eligible for an introductory offer for any product within the same subscription group. 
For example, customers are not eligible if they are upgrading, downgrading, or crossgrading their subscription from another product, 
regardless of whether they consumed an introductory offer in the past.


Display the Introductory Offer:
Once you determine the user is eligible for an introductory offer, query the App Store for available products, and present the offer to the user:
1.Retrieve localized information from the App Store about a specified list of subscription products using the SKProductsRequest class. Products that have an available discount defined in App Store Connect always include an introductoryPrice object.
2.Use the properties in the introductoryPrice object to display the discounted price for the subscription. Based on the type of the introductory offer (represented by SKProductDiscount.PaymentMode), display a UI that describes the offer accordingly.
