wildcard match domains: 通配符匹配域

In general iOS uses the DNS servers for the primary interface so, when your VPN claims the default route, it becomes the primary interface and thus its DNS servers are used.
If you don’t want to become the default route (that is, you want to create a split tunnel rather than a full tunnel) you have two options:
1.
You can configure specific match domains (via NEDNSSettings’s matchDomains property. 
When you do this, iOS will use your tunnel’s DNS server for any server inside those domains.
For example, the VPN for Waffle Varnishing Inc might list
waffle-varnishing.com
waffle-varnishing.some-cdn.com
waffle-varnishing.co.uk
and so on in its match domains.
2.
If you add an empty match domain (that is, set the property to an array containing an empty string), your DNS server is consulted before the primary interface’s DNS server.

So, you normally set up a VPN in one of three ways:
full tunnel — The VPN is the primary interface and its DNS server is used by default.
split tunnel, match domains — The VPN is not the primary interface and the system consults its VPN server for just the specified match domains.
split tunnel, wildcard match domains — The VPN is not the primary interface and the system consults its DNS server for all domains first.
