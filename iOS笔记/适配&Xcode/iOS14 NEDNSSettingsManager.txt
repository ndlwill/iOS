iOS14原生加密DNS方案

DNS解析是网络资源访问的第一跳，iOS 14 开始系统原生支持两种标准规范的 Encrypted DNS, 分别是 DNS over TLS 与 DNS over HTTPS，可以解决以下两个问题：
一、传统Local DNS的查询与回复均基于非加密UDP，发生我们常见的DNS劫持问题。
二、Local DNS Server本身不可信，或者本地Local DNS 服务不可用问题。

local DNS:
The primary aim of a local DNS (Domain Name System) server is to take domain name backup and is usually located on the network to which your computer is attached. 
When you need to access a website, you type the domain name, such as www.xyz.com, into the web browser instead of typing an IP address. 
The conversion automatically takes place inside. So this work also done by DNS server.
