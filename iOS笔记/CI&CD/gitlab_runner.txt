If you are using GitLab SaaS (GitLab.com), your CI jobs automatically run on shared runners.

Runners:
You can set up as many Runners as you need to run your jobs.
Runners can be placed on separate users, servers, and even on your local machine.
Each Runner can be in one of the following states:
active - Runner is active and can process any new jobs
paused - Runner is paused and will not receive any new jobs

Set up a specific Runner manually:
1.Install GitLab Runner on macOS:
https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gitlab-runner
