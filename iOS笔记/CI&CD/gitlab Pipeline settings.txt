==========Git strategy:
With Git strategy, you can choose the default way your repository is fetched from GitLab in a job.
There are two options. Using:

git clone, which is slower since it clones the repository from scratch
for every job, ensuring that the local working copy is always pristine.

git fetch, which is faster as it re-uses the local working copy (falling
back to clone if it doesn't exist).

The default Git strategy can be overridden by the GIT_STRATEGY variable
in .gitlab-ci.yml.

==========Git shallow clone:
It is possible to limit the number of changes that GitLab CI/CD fetches when cloning
a repository. Setting a limit to git depth can speed up Pipelines execution.
In GitLab 12.0 and later, newly created projects automatically have a default
git depth value of 50. The maximum allowed value is 1000.
To disable shallow clone and make GitLab CI/CD fetch all branches and tags each time,
keep the value empty or set to 0.
This value can also be overridden by GIT_DEPTH variable in .gitlab-ci.yml file.
