GitLab offers a continuous integration service. For each commit or push to trigger your CI
pipeline, you must:
Add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your repository's root directory.
Ensure your project is configured to use a runner.

The .gitlab-ci.yml file tells the runner what to do. A simple pipeline commonly has
three stages:
build
test
deploy
You do not need to use all three stages; stages with no jobs are ignored.
