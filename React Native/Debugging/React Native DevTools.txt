React Native DevTools is based on the Chrome DevTools frontend.
Chrome DevTools docs:

==================================================Core features
1. Console
The Console panel allows you to view and filter messages, evaluate JavaScript, inspect object properties, and more.

The Console panel allows you to view and filter messages, evaluate JavaScript, inspect object properties, and more.


Useful tips
If your app has a lot of logs, use the filter box or change the log levels that are shown.
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/live-expressions?hl=zh-cn
Watch values over time with Live Expressions.
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/reference#persist
Persist messages across reloads with Preserve Logs.
Use Ctrl + L to clear the console view.



2. Sources & breakpoints
The Sources panel allows you to view the source files in your app and register breakpoints. Use a breakpoint to define a line of code where your app should pause — allowing you to inspect the live state of the program and incrementally step through code.

Pause your code with breakpoints | Chrome DevTools


Navigate to a source file using the sidebar or Cmd ⌘+P / Ctrl+P.
Click in the line number column next to a line of code to add a breakpoint.
Use the navigation controls at the top right to step through code when paused.
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/reference?hl=zh-cn#stepping



A "Paused in Debugger" overlay will appear when your app is paused. Tap it to resume.
Pay attention to the right hand side panels when on a breakpoint, which allow you to inspect the current scope and call stack, and set watch expressions.
Use a debugger; statement to quickly set a breakpoint from your text editor. This will reach the device immediately via Fast Refresh.
There are multiple kinds of breakpoints! For example, Conditional Breakpoints and Logpoints.

3. Memory
The Memory panel allows you to take a heap snapshot and view the memory usage of your JavaScript code over time.

Record heap snapshots | Chrome DevTools
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots?hl=zh-cn

Useful tips
Use Cmd ⌘+F / Ctrl+F to filter for specific objects in the heap.
Taking an allocation timeline report can be useful to see memory usage over time as a graph, 
to identify possible memory leaks.

==================================================React DevTools features
In the integrated Components and Profiler panels, you'll find all the features of the React DevTools browser extension. 
These work seamlessly in React Native DevTools.
https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools

1. React Components
The React Components panel allows you to inspect and update the rendered React component tree.

Hover or select an element in DevTools to highlight it on device.
To locate an element in DevTools, click the top-left "Select element" button, then tap any element in the app.

Useful tips
Props and state on a component can be viewed and modified at runtime using the right hand panel.
Components optimized with React Compiler will be annotated with a "Memo ✨" badge.
https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler

Protip: Highlight re-renders
Re-renders can be a significant contributor to performance issues in React apps. 
DevTools can highlight component re-renders as they happen.
To enable, click the View Settings (⚙︎) icon and check "Highlight updates when components render".


2. React Profiler
The React Profiler panel allows you to record performance profiles to understand the timing of component renders and React commits.

==================================================Reconnecting DevTools
Occasionally, DevTools might disconnect from the target device. This can happen if:

The app is closed.
The app is rebuilt (a new native build is installed).
The app has crashed on the native side.
The dev server (Metro) is quit.
A physical device is disconnected.
On disconnect, a dialog will be shown with the message "Debugging connection was closed".

From here, you can either:
Dismiss: Select the close (×) icon or click outside the dialog to return to the DevTools UI in the last state before disconnection.
Reconnect: Select "Reconnect DevTools", having addressed the reason for disconnection.
