You can display the native logs for an iOS or Android app by using the following commands in a terminal while the app is running:
npx react-native log-ios
You may also access these through Debug > Open System Logâ€¦ in the iOS Simulator

Custom Native Logs
If you are writing a Native Module and want to add custom logs to your module for debugging purposes, you can use the following method:
NSLog(@"YourModuleName: %@", message);
print("YourModuleName: \(message)")
These logs will appear in the Xcode console when running the app.

Debugging in a Native IDE:
When working with native code, such as when writing native modules,
you can launch the app from Android Studio or Xcode and take advantage of the native debugging features (setting up breakpoints, etc.) as you would in case of building a standard native app.

Another option is to run your application using the React Native CLI and attach the native debugger of the native IDE (Android Studio or Xcode) to the process.
Xcode
On Xcode click on "Debug" on the top menu bar, select the "Attach to process" option,
and select the application in the list of "Likely Targets".
