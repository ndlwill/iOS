Data Race:
Multiple threads access shared mutable state, at least one writes, without synchronization:

// Data race
var counter = 0
DispatchQueue.global().async { counter += 1 }
DispatchQueue.global().async { counter += 1 }

Detection: Enable Thread Sanitizer in scheme settings.

Prevention: Use actors or Sendable types:

actor Counter {
    private var value = 0
    
    func increment() {
        value += 1
    }
}





Race Condition:
Timing-dependent behavior leading to unpredictable results:

let counter = Counter()

for _ in 1...10 {
    Task { await counter.increment() }
}

// May print inconsistent values
print(await counter.getValue())

Key difference: Swift Concurrency prevents data races but not race conditions. 
You must still ensure proper sequencing.
