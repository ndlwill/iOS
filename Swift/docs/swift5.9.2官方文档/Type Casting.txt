Determine a value’s runtime type and give it more specific type information.

Type casting in Swift is implemented with the is and as operators. 
These two operators provide a simple and expressive way to check the type of a value or cast a value to a different type.
You can also use type casting to check whether a type conforms to a protocol

class MediaItem {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
class Movie: MediaItem {
    var director: String
    init(name: String, director: String) {
        self.director = director
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}
class Song: MediaItem {
    var artist: String
    init(name: String, artist: String) {
        self.artist = artist
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}

let library = [
    Movie(name: "Casablanca", director: "Michael Curtiz"),
    Song(name: "Blue Suede Shoes", artist: "Elvis Presley"),
    Movie(name: "Citizen Kane", director: "Orson Welles"),
    Song(name: "The One And Only", artist: "Chesney Hawkes"),
    Song(name: "Never Gonna Give You Up", artist: "Rick Astley")
]
// the type of "library" is inferred to be [MediaItem]


Checking Type:
var movieCount = 0
var songCount = 0
for item in library {
    if item is Movie {
        movieCount += 1
    } else if item is Song {
        songCount += 1
    }
}

print("Media library contains \(movieCount) movies and \(songCount) songs")
// Prints "Media library contains 2 movies and 3 songs"


Downcasting:
A constant or variable of a certain class type may actually refer to an instance of a subclass behind the scenes. 
Where you believe this is the case, you can try to downcast to the subclass type with a type cast operator (as? or as!).

Because downcasting can fail, the type cast operator comes in two different forms. 
The conditional form, as?, returns an optional value of the type you are trying to downcast to. 
The forced form, as!, attempts the downcast and force-unwraps the result as a single compound action.

for item in library {
    if let movie = item as? Movie {
        print("Movie: \(movie.name), dir. \(movie.director)")
    } else if let song = item as? Song {
        print("Song: \(song.name), by \(song.artist)")
    }
}
// Movie: Casablanca, dir. Michael Curtiz
// Song: Blue Suede Shoes, by Elvis Presley
// Movie: Citizen Kane, dir. Orson Welles
// Song: The One And Only, by Chesney Hawkes
// Song: Never Gonna Give You Up, by Rick Astley

Note:
Casting doesn’t actually modify the instance or change its values. 
The underlying instance remains the same; it’s simply treated and accessed as an instance of the type to which it has been cast.


Type Casting for Any and AnyObject:
Swift provides two special types for working with nonspecific types:
Any can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types.
AnyObject can represent an instance of any class type.

var things: [Any] = []
things.append(0)
things.append(0.0)
things.append(42)
things.append(3.14159)
things.append("hello")
things.append((3.0, 5.0))
things.append(Movie(name: "Ghostbusters", director: "Ivan Reitman"))
things.append({ (name: String) -> String in "Hello, \(name)" })

for thing in things {
    switch thing {
    case 0 as Int:
        print("zero as an Int")
    case 0 as Double:
        print("zero as a Double")
    case let someInt as Int:
        print("an integer value of \(someInt)")
    case let someDouble as Double where someDouble > 0:
        print("a positive double value of \(someDouble)")
    case is Double:
        print("some other double value that I don't want to print")
    case let someString as String:
        print("a string value of \"\(someString)\"")
    case let (x, y) as (Double, Double):
        print("an (x, y) point at \(x), \(y)")
    case let movie as Movie:
        print("a movie called \(movie.name), dir. \(movie.director)")
    case let stringConverter as (String) -> String:
        print(stringConverter("Michael"))
    default:
        print("something else")
    }
}
// zero as an Int
// zero as a Double
// an integer value of 42
// a positive double value of 3.14159
// a string value of "hello"
// an (x, y) point at 3.0, 5.0
// a movie called Ghostbusters, dir. Ivan Reitman
// Hello, Michael

Note:
The Any type represents values of any type, including optional types. 
Swift gives you a warning if you use an optional value where a value of type Any is expected. 
If you really do need to use an optional value as an Any value, you can use the as operator to explicitly cast the optional to Any, as shown below.

let optionalNumber: Int? = 3
things.append(optionalNumber)        // Warning
things.append(optionalNumber as Any) // No warning
