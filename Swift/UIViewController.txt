UIViewController.init calls UIViewController.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil). 
That means that the nibName will be equal to the name of the class and bundle will be the main bundle.

UIViewController.init is just a convenience initializer. 
In swift this could be implemented using default parameters UIViewController.init(nibName: String? = nil, bundle: NSBundle? = nil) 
but this is an old Objective-C API and Objective-C does not have default parameters and that's why there is a separate convenience init()
