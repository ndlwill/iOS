In Swift, the @convention attribute is used to define the calling convention of a function type.

This function type can be a C function, a block, or a Swift function.
Understanding how to use @convention is crucial for developers who want to interact with C code from Swift, or when you need to use Swift functions as callbacks for C APIs.

In Swift, you can use the @convention attribute to specify the calling convention of a function type.
There are three types of conventions: 'c', 'block', and 'swift'. 
The 'c' convention is used for C function pointer types, the 'block' convention for Objective-C blocks, and the 'swift' convention for Swift function types.


// C function pointer type
@convention(c) typealias CFunction = (Int) -> Int

// Objective-C block type
@convention(block) typealias ObjCBlock = (Int) -> Int

// Swift function type
@convention(swift) typealias SwiftFunction = (Int) -> Int


1.
When you want to use a C function as a callback, or when declaring a function pointer to a C function, you can use @convention(c).

import Darwin

// Declare a function pointer to a C function
typealias SignalHandler = @convention(c) (Int32) -> Void

func swiftSignalHandler(code: Int32) {
    print("Signal caught in Swift: \(code)")
}

var cSignalHandler: SignalHandler = swiftSignalHandler

signal(SIGINT, cSignalHandler)

This code declares a function pointer to a C function using @convention(c), defines a Swift function swiftSignalHandler(), and assigns it to the C function pointer.
Then it uses the signal() function from the Darwin module to catch the SIGINT signal and handle it with the Swift function.


2.
When you need to use a Swift closure as an Objective-C block, you can use @convention(block). 
This is useful when interacting with Objective-C APIs that require blocks.

import Foundation

// Declare a Swift closure as an Objective-C block
typealias CompletionHandler = @convention(block) (NSString) -> Void

let swiftClosure: CompletionHandler = { name in
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

let objCBlock: AnyObject = unsafeBitCast(swiftClosure, to: AnyObject.self)
// Now you can use objCBlock as an Objective-C block


This code declares a Swift closure as an Objective-C block using @convention(block), 
defines a Swift closure swiftClosure(), and then uses unsafeBitCast() to cast it to AnyObject. 
Now, objCBlock can be used as an Objective-C block.
