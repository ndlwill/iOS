https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/attributes/#nonobjc

When you use the @objc(name) attribute on a Swift class, the class is made available in Objective-C without any namespacing.

Conversely, Swift also provides the @nonobjc attribute, which makes a Swift declaration unavailable in Objective-C.

To summarize,
use @objc when you want to expose a Swift attribute to Objective-C without a namespace 
Use @nonobjc if you want to keep the attribute available and accessible only in Swift code.
