Framework
SwiftUI
Declare the user interface and behavior for your app on every platform.

Define your app structure using the App protocol, and populate it with scenes that contain the views that make up your app’s user interface. 
Create your own custom views that conform to the View protocol, and compose them with SwiftUI views for displaying text, images, and custom shapes using stacks, lists, and more.
Apply powerful modifiers to built-in views and your own views to customize their rendering and interactivity.
Share code between apps on multiple platforms with views and controls that adapt to their context and presentation.

You can integrate SwiftUI views with objects from the UIKit, AppKit, and WatchKit frameworks to take further advantage of platform-specific functionality.
You can also customize accessibility support in SwiftUI, and localize your app’s interface for different languages, countries, or cultural regions.
