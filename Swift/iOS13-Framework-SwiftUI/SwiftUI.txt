Framework
SwiftUI
Declare the user interface and behavior for your app on every platform.

Define your app structure using the App protocol, and populate it with scenes that contain the views that make up your app’s user interface. 
Create your own custom views that conform to the View protocol, and compose them with SwiftUI views for displaying text, images, and custom shapes using stacks, lists, and more.
Apply powerful modifiers to built-in views and your own views to customize their rendering and interactivity.
Share code between apps on multiple platforms with views and controls that adapt to their context and presentation.

You can integrate SwiftUI views with objects from the UIKit, AppKit, and WatchKit frameworks to take further advantage of platform-specific functionality.
You can also customize accessibility support in SwiftUI, and localize your app’s interface for different languages, countries, or cultural regions.


SwiftUI 是一种声明式 UI 框架，通过声明视图的结构、布局和数据绑定，使开发者能够以更简洁、直观的方式构建用户界面。
SwiftUI 使用数据绑定来自动更新 UI。当绑定的数据发生变化时，视图会自动重新渲染。这种数据驱动的更新机制简化了 UI 更新的复杂性


SwiftUI is a reactive framework where the data drives the UI.
