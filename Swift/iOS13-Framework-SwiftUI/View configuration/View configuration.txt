View configuration
Adjust the characteristics of views in a hierarchy.

SwiftUI enables you to tune the appearance and behavior of views using view modifiers.

Many modifiers apply to specific kinds of views or behaviors, but some apply more generally.
For example, you can conditionally hide any view by dynamically setting its opacity, 
display contextual help when people hover over a view, or request the light or dark appearance for a view.
