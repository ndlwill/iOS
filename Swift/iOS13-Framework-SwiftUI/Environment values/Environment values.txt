Environment values
Share data throughout a view hierarchy using the environment.

Views in SwiftUI can react to configuration information that they read from the environment using an Environment property wrapper.

A view inherits its environment from its container view, subject to explicit changes from an environment(_:_:) view modifier, 
or by implicit changes from one of the many modifiers that operate on environment values.
As a result, you can configure a entire hierarchy of views by modifying the environment of the groupâ€™s container.

You can find many built-in environment values in the EnvironmentValues structure.
You can also create custom values using the EnvironmentKey protocol.
