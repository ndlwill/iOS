func environmentObject<T>(_ object: T) -> some View where T : ObservableObject

object:
The object to store and make available to the view’s hierarchy.

Use this modifier to add an observable object to a view’s environment. 
The object must conform to the ObservableObject protocol.

Adding an object to a view’s environment makes the object available to subviews in the view’s hierarchy. 
To retrieve the object in a subview, use the EnvironmentObject property wrapper.

#####
Note
If the observable object conforms to the Observable protocol, 
use either environment(_:) or the environment(_:_:) modifier to add the object to the view’s environment.
