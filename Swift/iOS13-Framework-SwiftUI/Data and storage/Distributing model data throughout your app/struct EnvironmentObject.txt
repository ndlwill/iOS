A property wrapper type for an observable object that a parent or ancestor view supplies.
iOS13.0
@frozen @propertyWrapper
struct EnvironmentObject<ObjectType> where ObjectType : ObservableObject

An environment object invalidates the current view whenever the observable object that conforms to ObservableObject changes.
If you declare a property as an environment object, be sure to set a corresponding model object on an ancestor view by calling its environmentObject(_:) modifier.

#####
Note
If your observable object conforms to the Observable protocol, 
use Environment instead of EnvironmentObject and set the model object in an ancestor view by calling its environment(_:) or environment(_:_:) modifiers.
