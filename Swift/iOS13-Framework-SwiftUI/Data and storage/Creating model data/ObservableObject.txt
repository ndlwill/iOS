ObservableObject iOS13.0
A type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed.

protocol ObservableObject : AnyObject
By default an ObservableObject synthesizes an objectWillChange publisher that emits the changed value before any of its @Published properties changes.

class Contact: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name: String
    @Published var age: Int

    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }

    func haveBirthday() -> Int {
        age += 1
        return age
    }
}


let john = Contact(name: "John Appleseed", age: 24)
cancellable = john.objectWillChange
    .sink { _ in
        print("\(john.age) will change")
}
print(john.haveBirthday())
// Prints "24 will change"
// Prints "25"
