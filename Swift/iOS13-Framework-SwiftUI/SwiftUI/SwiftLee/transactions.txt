Disable animations on a specific view in SwiftUI using transactions

#####
Compared to UIKit, SwiftUI makes it easier to create animated transitions between two states using the animation view modifier. 
You can see each animation as a transaction between a from and to state. // 您可以将每个动画视为起始状态和结束状态之间的事务
We can alter this transaction using the transaction view modifier
#####

==================================================Using the transaction view modifier
transaction view modifier that allows you to adjust a transaction between two states.
A transaction contains the context of the current state-processing update, animated or not, 
meaning that this modifier calls even when you’re not animating the changes.
You can verify this as follows:

.transaction { transaction in
    print(transaction.animation) // Prints: nil when not animated.
}

We can use this same transaction modifier to disable the animation as we would before:

.transaction { transaction in
    transaction.animation = nil
}
