Implemented (Swift 5.0)

Proposed solution
We add a way to refer to the identity key path, which refers to the entire input value a key path applies to.

Every value in Swift has a special pseudo-property .self, which refers to the entire value:
var x = 1
x.self = 2
print(x.self) // prints 2

By analogy, we could spell the identity key path \.self, since it notionally refers to this self member:
let id = \Int.self
x[keyPath: id] = 3
print(x[keyPath: id]) // prints 3 // 类似给对象通过ketpath设置属性
print(x) // prints 3
